# RegNet
Implementation of RegNet which builds on ResNet by adding an RNN-Regulator Module to preserve the spatio-temporal data between residual blocks.
No official code of the [RegNet] paper was provided so I created this repository. Read the paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00590 . Pull requests
are most certainly welcome :)
